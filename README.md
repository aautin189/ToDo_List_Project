TO-DO List Project

====================================
Objective:

Build an interactive web app using JS. 

====================================
Approach:

1. copy & pasted source code from CodePen
2. figure out how this source code is working currently 
3. add commenting to source code files
4. going to restyle the page to my liking
5. create a separate repo for this project
6. need to link to this project from my portfolio page (which is live currently)
	- considering making this an actual project to be displayed from inside the 'Projects' section of my home page
	- like we discussed with Ted, have a button to access source code and a second button to demo the live project
